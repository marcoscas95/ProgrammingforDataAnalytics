The annual rate of inflation in the United States hit 6.2% in October 2021. Therefore, we decided to see what people are saying on twitter about inflation. Has this been noticeable to people or has it not been noticeable? One of the bigger factors on inflation in 2021 has been the coronavirus pandemic which produced a stronger consumer demand after the economy reopened. We want to analyze how people are reacting to inflation and what do they have to say about it.  

## Description

In order to obtain data that relates to United States’ inflation rate, we created a Twitter Developer API account to be able to collect tweets data. We have been collecting tweets with the word “Inflation” on it and the hashtag #inflation to have a general idea of what everyone is saying about overall prices going up. We have been running the code to collect tweets several times in order to have a good amount of tweets in our database. After we have enough data, we plan to start analyzing it by performing text analysis of the tweets to understand better what people is saying about the inflation and if they think it is really affecting the economy or if it is not as bad as it seems. We will also be doing data visualization of the data and creating models to understand better the data and be able to interpret the information of all the tweets we found about inflation.
